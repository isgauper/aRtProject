Remaining Tasks
===========

* ~~Read in image~~ David
* ~~Convert image to clear, simple horizon~~ David
* ~~Add diagonal snow flakes~~ Will
* Getting the height and width when the image is read in
* At the moment the script is hard coded to use a particular channel (at the moment) red when it runs. Better would be choosing via a flag you can set when giving it an image. Best (but a lot of work) would be the script does a bunch of really clever analysis to figure out the sky/land.
* Add legend or "falling" and "fallen"
* Add title
